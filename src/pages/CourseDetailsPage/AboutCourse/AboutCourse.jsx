            The popular front-end framework React.js suggests using Next.js for
            web development in its documentation! It's evident that Next.js is
            leading the future in web development. If you aspire to be a
            top-notch developer, you'll definitely want speed on your side,
            which Next.js with Prisma can provide.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What is Next.js?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            In modern web development, React.js is now a very popular go-to
            framework. On the other hand, Next.js is an open-source Node.js
            framework that easily creates scalable server-side applications.
            It's built using TypeScript, making it ideal for building scalable
            and testable applications. It supports PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and
            MySQL databases.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What is Prisma?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Prisma is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) toolkit used for
            Node.js and TypeScript. It's often referred to as the next
            generation ORM, which, when combined with Next.js, creates a
            powerful stack.

            Why Use React.js, Next.js with Prisma?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            After learning React.js, when you start using Next.js with Prisma,
            you can work much faster compared to other stacks. Additionally, the
            learning curve is much shorter. In the case of using stacks like PHP
            or MERN, you often have to deal with many libraries that can be
            challenging to install. These complications are greatly reduced with
            this stack. In a short time, you can become an expert full-stack
            developer.
